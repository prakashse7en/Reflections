When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i want to share my files for editing with my other colleagues

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
to keep the files in git files intact and maually merge ,as git will act as back up
