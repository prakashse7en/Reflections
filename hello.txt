hello


Multiple calls to same API via spring integartion 

Problem definition:
Initially business api accepts single request and single response
Currently We receive list of request aggregated as a single request that needs to be sent an business api which accepts only one . So we need to make recursive calls to 
business Api to achieve this 

Design
To overcome this we have built an channel , gateway , and splitter for splitting the list and a router which is used for generating channels (in my case it is not working) and aggregated for grouping the response


 <int:router input-channel="outSplitChannel" ref="mySplitRouter" method="route" /> 
		<bean id="mySplitRouter" class="SplitRouter" /> 

		
In the bean following was added
		
		public List<String> route(Request proxyRequest){
		List<String> listOfCall = new ArrayList<String>();
		for(AccNbrGroup singNbr:proxyRequest.getGroup()){
			listOfCall.add("RouteChannel");
		}
		return listOfCall;
	}
	
	Problem is the channels are not generated dynamically? Could some one help . in summary i need to call the busineess the for the size of list present in request
