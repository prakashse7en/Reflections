Defining dynamic channels in scatter gather 

in case of scatter gather static channels are defined(i.e channels are known prior designing ) from which the response will be aggregated .

insert scatter gather pic 

Is it possible to define dynamic channel .

In my case ,have java arraylist(dynamic) of size 3(size differs each time) like

	ArrayList
		1-> request for business api call(samp)
		2-> request for business api call(samp)
		3-> request for business api call(samp)
	i.e for each element of arraylist i need to call the business api(samp is the business api, here it should be called 3 times). Since size differs each time , how to apply scather gather spring integration pattern here? Is any other spring integration pattern can be applied here?
		
	Things done for above problem  (but below approach is a Sequential way of handling ,is it possible to process each call parallely) :

	Arraylist apiResponse
	for each element in array list	
		call business api 
		apiResponse.add(eachElement Response)
		
		
spring integration , java , enterprise integration pattern
